                    I started my university life as a predegree students and keep out top 8 in my class and got my easy addmission in to petroleum engineering, after which i stated my proper undergraduate
                    journey in 2018. Smooth journey untill covid hit in 2020, prolonged my 200 level and not to forget, 200 level was my most hectic level.
                    I faced quite a challenge with technical dawing , but i overcome with littile help from youtube. moving on to my project days in 500 level, another very hectic level,

                    <p style="font-size:20px;text-align: justify;padding-right: 40px; color: blueviolet;">My project work focused on an investigation on alkyl polyglycosides for enhanced oil recovery. Due to he continous 
                        decline in oil over the years, new methods have been explored since the 1900 to help produce hydrocarbon the surfe, on of which is surfactacnt flooding, which include APG(Alkylpolyglycosides),
                        made of carbonhydrate source, fatty alcohol using acid as caalyst at eleveated temperature.
                        the workmexplored APG at different concentrations and presuure and with increaing time the recovery got beteer.
                        it was compared with sodium lauryl sulfate and showed that APG is an efficient and sustainable means of EOR nd showed be further improved on to meet the challenges of Enhanced oil recovery.
